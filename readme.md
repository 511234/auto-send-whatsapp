## Background

My gooooood🐷 friend wants to automatically send Whatsapp to a bunch of people. He tried VBA but has many constraints. I turn to Python for some breakthrough. :D

## Steps to use:

```
python3 -m venv env
```

```
source env/bin/activate
```

```
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install keyboard
```

```

```

## FAQ
Message is shown on Whatsapp Web but pyautogui `click` and `typewrite` are not working.
